Hello! I'm Krishnan Chandra, a software engineer based in New York City. I love building impactful solutions with distributed systems.

I currently serve as a Principal Engineer at [Ramp](https://ramp.com), where I focus on the areas of identity and authorization.

Previously, I was the CTO and Co-Founder of Human Intelligence, the team behind [SixAI](https://sixhq.ai) and [ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbit.ai). This experience was invaluable and helped to hone my skills in leadership and product development.

My foundation in backend engineering was built at leading companies like [Confluent](https://confluent.io), [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Optimizely](https://optimizely.com), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com). I hold dual degrees in mathematics and computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to my community through volunteering, and pursuing my love for soccer.
