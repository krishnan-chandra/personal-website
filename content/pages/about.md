Hi! I'm Krishnan Chandra and I'm a software engineer based in New York City.

I'm currently CTO and Co-Founder at [Human Intelligence](https://humanintelligence.ai/). We are the creators of [ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbit.ai/) and [SixAI](https://sixhq.ai).

Previously, I worked at a software engineer (primarily backend eng / distributed systems stuff) at companies like [Confluent](https://confluent.io/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/), [Optimizely](https://optimizely.com/), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/); outside of work, I am primarily interested in volunteering and soccer.
