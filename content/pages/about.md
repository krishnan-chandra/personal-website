Hi! I'm Krishnan Chandra and I'm a software engineer based in New York City.

I'm currently the CTO and Co-Founder at [SixAI](https://sixhq.ai). We are also the creators of [ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbit.ai/).

Previously, I worked at a backend software engineer at [Confluent](https://confluent.io/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/), [Optimizely](https://optimizely.com/), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/). Educationally, I received double degrees in mathematics and computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Outside of work, I am primarily interested in volunteering and soccer.
