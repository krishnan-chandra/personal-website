Hi! I'm Krishnan Chandra and I'm a software engineer based in New York City.

I'm currently a co-founder at [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/), and previously worked at [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) on backend engineering; outside of work, I am primarily interested in volunteering and soccer.
